# Sherlock and the Beast
Sherlock Holmes is getting paranoid about Professor Moriarty, his arch-enemy. All his efforts to subdue Moriarty have been in vain. These days Sherlock is working on a problem with Dr. Watson. Watson mentioned that the CIA has been facing weird problems with their supercomputer, 'The Beast', recently.

This afternoon, Sherlock received a note from Moriarty, saying that he has infected 'The Beast' with a virus. Moreover, the note had the number N printed on it. After doing some calculations, Sherlock figured out that the key to remove the virus is the largest Decent Number having N digits.

A Decent Number has the following properties:
1. 3, 5, or both as its digits. No other digit is allowed.
2. Number of times 3 appears is divisible by 5.
3. Number of times 5 appears is divisible by 3.

Meanwhile, the counter to the destruction of 'The Beast' is running very fast. Can you save 'The Beast', and find the key before Sherlock?
